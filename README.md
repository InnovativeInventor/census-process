## census-process
This is a processing pipeline for PL-94 U.S. Census redistricting data.
It turns raw Census data into usable shapefiles, which can then be imported and analyzed by GIS software like GeoPandas and QGIS.
Additionally, it produces composite racial/ethnic columns like `APBVAP20` (the number of persons that are any part black and of voting age).

You can download these shapefiles here: http://data.mggg.org.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/census-2020/.

## Usage
Running `main.py` will produce files inside the `final/` folder.

```
python main.py [state] [census_level] [census_ftp_location]
```

For example, 

```
python main.py AL block
```

will produce files in `final/al/`.

If you want to generate shapefiles for the entire country, then run:
```
bash run.sh
```
